# JavaScript 30 projects

This project is intended to hune my skills on Javascript majorly to build my confidence in creating real project.     
Every project for the 30days series is in seperate folders.     
Project Day 1 => Lesson 1 and so on.    
Many thanks to Wes Bos for challenging young devs like me to keep pushing.
